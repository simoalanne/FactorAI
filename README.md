# 🏭 FactorAI

**FactorAI** is a small factory-themed mobile game built in Unity, where players will use artificial intelligence to help restore an old, struggling factory back to life.

🎮 Gameplay revolves around a couple of mini-games inspired by factory tasks:

- Combine products in a merge-style mini-game
- Quickly grab the correct items before time runs out in a catch falling items mini-game
- With enough gained points from the mini-games, activate AI to "play" (skip) the mini-games for you, helping you rack up high scores and bring the factory back to full production.
